# Calculator_Project1

WELCOME NOTE: I created different themes(dark, light, red, pink) in basic calculator code along with square root, mod, addition, subtraction, and division operations. Our application is applicable to Windows, Mac OS, and mobile phones. I created a left parenthesis and a right parenthesis on a new page. Also, my calculator contains dark and light, pink and green themes with background color. I provided my app with menu items and flyouts for navigation purposes. I have created a grid layout and buttons for Squareroot and Mod.
